# Social Housing Complaints AI
This repository is for the 'Why-Aye AI' group to share AI learning and prompt templates from the Community Sprints in Newcastle in October 2024. 

# Why-Aye AI

# Project Overview
## Vision & Goals
The aim of our project was to explore the new generative AI tools within Salesforce, and specifically look at how these could be used to assist our colleagues in complaint handling. This is an issue across the sector, where complaint handling satisfaction is low (average 34%) and volumes of complaints continue to rise. 
* Explore how AI can be used to assist colleagues in handling a complaint case
* Use field-gen AI to generate summaries which can be used in complaints letters
* Use email AI within Salesforce to write complaint responses to customers
* Assess the output quality and find top tips to help others
* Share prompts which can be tailored by organisations 

## Social Housing
We have designed our templates and guidance specifically for Social Housing companies, but anticipate this could be used in the non-profit and corporate sector too. 

## [Trailblazer Group or Slack Channel Link (access required)](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/groups/0F94S000000kF8JSAU?tab=discussion&sort=LAST_MODIFIED_DATE_DESC)
We have a Salesforce Housing Sector private group in the Trailblazer community. The vision for this group is to create a peer learning space for Salesforce customers in the Housing sector. We do this through quarterly get-togethers, sharing each other's utilisation of the platform and Salesforce-based technology innovations that support housing practices. We leverage collective knowledge and experience with Salesforce, learning from experts from Salesforce and partners, and creating peer-to-peer connections.
